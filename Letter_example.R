# [ToDo] Try the algorithm LRMultiClass with lambda = 1 and 50 iterations. Call the resulting object out, i.e. out <- LRMultiClass(...)

# Feel free to modify the code above for different lambda/eta/numIter values to see how it affects the convergence as well as train/test errors

# [ToDo] Use microbenchmark to time your code with lambda=1 and 50 iterations. To save time, only apply microbenchmark 5 times.

# [ToDo] Report the median time of your code from microbenchmark above in the comments below
# Median time:  (in sec)
# Median time is 3.160486 secs.
